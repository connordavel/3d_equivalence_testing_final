# Can you derive it from other info? 
# ***Answer***: Maybe? It would be hard and openeye/rdkit percieve this already if given enough info
    # Criteria for aromaticity: 
        # 1) circular: you could search through the atoms and their neighbors recursively until you found a repeat Idx? 
        # 2) conjugated: No idea. Search for alternating single/double bonds? See if everything is sp2 hybridized?
        # 3) 4n+2 rule: for every double bond, add 2 pi electrons. for every negative formal charge on an atom, add 2 pi electrons 
# What does an inchi look like when aromaticity is present in the molecule?
# ***Answer***: reading aromaticity from InchI must be inferred from whatever software is writing a molecule from
    # the given InchI string. In other words, InchI does not give bond order info nor does it specifiy which atoms 
    # are aromatic explicitly. I'm guessing RDKit differentiates between an aromatic and nonaromatic molecule by
    # perceiving bond orders from degrees of unsaturation, general structure, etc. 
# let's compare cyclohexane and benzene (note that only RDKit can read in an InChI string):
for mol in mols:
    if mol['iupac'] == 'cyclohexane':
        cyclohexane = Chem.inchi.MolFromInchi(mol['inchi'])
    if mol['iupac'] == 'benzene':
        benzene = Chem.inchi.MolFromInchi(mol['inchi'])
print("\n\ncyclohexane      benzene \n atoms            atoms")
for c_atom, b_atom in zip(cyclohexane.GetAtoms(), benzene.GetAtoms()):
    print(f"{c_atom.GetSymbol()}:", end='')
    # Testing to see if it could recognize the aromatic atoms
    print(f"({c_atom.GetIsAromatic()})", end="\t")

    print(f"{b_atom.GetSymbol()}:", end='')
    # Testing to see if it could recognize the aromatic atoms
    print(f"({b_atom.GetIsAromatic()})", end="\n")
# so yes, rdkit somehow perceives aromaticity from an InchI string format 


# How does InChI represent resonance states? And formal charge? Eg guandinium or arginine?
# InChI has an optional charge layer that can be used to store OVERALL charge info. In guanidinium, the charge
# layer can be seen with the "/p+1" tag: 
    # guanidinium: InChI=1S/CH5N3/c2-1(3)4/h(H5,2,3,4)/p+1
# compare this to SMILES which specifies charge info for each atom:
    # guanidinium: C(=[NH2+])(N)N   
    #                     ^
    # notice the "+" and specified 2 protons on the given nitrogen 
# InChI does not store formal charge or bond orders, so it is a logical conclusion (aka "I haven't looked this up but it seems obvious") 
# that InChI cannot store resonance states like SMILES 

# Does the same molecule always make the same inchi, or could it be represented by multiple InChIs?
    # Inchi keys have multiple layers that can store information, and the programmer can choose to what detail--how
    # many levels--he/she chooses to represent their molecule with. The only required levels are the chemical formula
    # level, and the connectivity level. Additional levels such as charge, explicit protons, isotopes can be used or 
    # not depending on the level of detail needed. 

    # Excluding isotopes, strange charges, stereochem, etc. an InChI key will only ever represent one molecule. It is
    # impossible to construct two different molecules from the same InChI string (again, not taking stereochemistry, isomers,
    # etc. into account)
# What is canonicalization? 
    # Standardizing the format of some data so that everyone can be on the same page. This is done to ease the transition 
    # of using data from one website, database, software, etc. to another. It would be a pain if you had to manually reformat 
    # your data every time you had to search for a molecule of use a different drug database
# Is there a canonical InChI?
    # Yes: Standard InChI. This is denoted by the "S" in "InChI=1S". For searching/database purposes, you can use the InChIKey 
    # format.

# 1) figure out how to read a mol2 file with multiple molecules into rdkit
# 2) solve or accound for all errors that occur while reading in files
# 3) maybe implement a dataframe or something to help organize files/molecules
# 4) go through and test that all molecules were read in correctly
# 5) unpack or write to a compressed gz (learn gzip moldule)file
# 6) MiniDrugBank.sdf: do rdkit and openeye read all these molecules the same?
# 7) - how to compare molecules that are read into rdkit vs. openeye?
# 8) - compare, graphs(stereo, aromaticity, connectivity, atoms), partial charge, isomers(?), conformers etc.
# 9) - better coding pratices, less experimental code, more OO programming, get a final product
# 10) - make the software very readable, easy to follow the logical flow.
# 11) - make functions first, think about classes later 
# 12) - what are the details of a jupyter(?) notebook.
